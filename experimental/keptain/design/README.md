# Kubernetes KEP Explorer

This website is a simple website that allows the user to explore kubernetes KEPs.

We will start with basic "display" features,
and then add more features over time that streamline the KEP process,
for maintainers as well as for contributors.

## Features

### Basic Display Features

We should be able to display a list of KEPs,
and for each KEP we have a landing page that displays the KEP content.

Initially we link to the full KEP content from the landing page,
showing only keep metadata for each KEP.
