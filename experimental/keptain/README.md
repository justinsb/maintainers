Simple KEP explorer website.

This is an experiment to see if we can make it easier for
maintainers to work with KEPs.

It doesn't do much yet, it is mostly setting up a framework
for us to start to put value-add ideas.

## Running

First, you should check out the KEPs repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements.git
```

Then, you can run the website:
```
go run .
```

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
